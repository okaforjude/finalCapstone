# 1. Natural Language Processing

### Description
The first objective of this project is to categorize diverse natural language processing (NLP) use-cases into four main categories: Text classification, Automatic summarization, Sentiment analysis, and Question answering. The aim is to assist users in comprehending the different NLP applications and their respective uses, and to provide guidance in selecting the most appropriate application for their requirements.

The project also present a concise overview of Google's BERT technology that utilizes NLP, its capabilities and functions, as well as a general description of its workings. The intended audience for this project comprises individuals who are keenly interested in Natural Language Processing and wish to enhance their understanding of Google's BERT technology.

### Overview
This projects has two sections named Compulsory Task 1 and Compulsory Task 2. Compulsory Task 1 categorizes NLP for some use-cases. You can navigate the file to find a use-case that you're interested in, and check its category to understand which type of NLP application is most suitable for it. The four categories are:Text classification, Automatic summarization, Sentiment analysis and Question answering. This project also provides an overview of BERT, its workings, and some of its applications in various industries.

# 2. Finance Calculators

### Description
The Python script enables users to compute the amount of interest they would earn on an investment or the amount they would have to pay on a home loan (bond). By utilizing mathematical formulas, the script determines the total interest or monthly repayment, based on the user's input. This project serves as a valuable tool for individuals seeking to compute the total interest or monthly repayment on an investment or home loan in a timely manner.
